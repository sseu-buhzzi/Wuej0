## Features

- Swipe gestures for moving and zooming, or use arrow keys to move, zoom, and rotate.
- Map tile caching for offline use.
- Location and orientation support.
- (Previously) supported uploading user locations to my server over an RSA-encrypted channel, and viewing the locations of all users. This server has since been shut down.
